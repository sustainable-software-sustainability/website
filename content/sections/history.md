## History of WoSSS
The Knowledge Exchange Group (KEG) deserves credits for organizing a first workshop on software sustainability in 2015 in Berlin. The results of this workshop are published in the form of a report. This workshop was followed up by a next one (WoSSS17) in the Hague, organized and co-sponsored by DANS and the Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) in the UK, renaming the activity as Workshop on Sustainable Software Sustainability (WoSSS). A third workshop (WoSSS19) was then co-organized and co-sponsored by DANS, SSI and The Netherlands eScience Center.

## Character of WoSSS
In the course of the past three events, the WoSSS series of workshops has developed a distinct character of broadness, to-the-point introductions to topics followed by open discussions, a three days event, including a social event (dinner) and a prepared reporting structure. The present partners involved in the organisation seek to maintain this character, as it has led to content full and useful reports.

An example of the broadness of the workshop is the inclusion of cultural heritage participants such as national libraries, national archives, broadcasting heritage organisations and those involved with old film and games preservation. This is alongside the traditional research and development organisations who are focused on sustainable software.
