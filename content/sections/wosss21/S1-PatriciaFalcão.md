# Software Sustainability in the context of Software-based Art Conservation
**by Patricia Falcão**  

## From session 1 - [Sustaining software in cultural heritage](/wosss21-agenda#session-1)  
Software sustainability and Conservation of software-based art have many similarities and some key differences. This talk will provide my perspective as a conservator and researcher working in the conservation of software-based art and explain my view of the differences and similarities , and where I see space for close collaboration.

Artist’s software is as varied as the artists themselves and their teams. Even a small collection like Tate’s, that at the moment contains less than 15 artworks, where the earliest  is from 2013, includes works created in and for 5 different Operating Systems, applications created using Java, Delphi or C++ and tools such as Director or Unity.
The functions of the software vary between creating randomness in drawings in the work Becoming (2003) by Michael Craig-Martin and choreographing the movement of a oversized puppet in Jordan Wolfson’s Colored Sculpture (2016)

A conservator in an institution needs to learn how to preserve both the conceptual and material aspects of these types of works, for their artistic and historical value. This includes documenting the systems used and how to run and calibrate the software, with the aim of ensuring that the artworks that the software creates can be displayed “in perpetuity”.  This implies the preservation of running systems, in a gallery, for the public. Often there is the need to change the software that runs an artwork, and the role of the conservator is to understand how those changes may impact a work’s meaning, and ensure that its behaviours are as little changed as possible.

Conservation practitioners are trained within a now fairly long tradition, centred on scientific practices, technical skill and thorough documentation processes. Underlying all these aspects is a code of ethics that guides decision-making when intervening in an object. For more traditional objects, the aim is to prevent change, but contemporary art practice, not just software-based art, has questioned this aim and for any digital or media-based work conservators strive to manage change which, given the dependence of this type of objects on mass-produced technology, is accepted as inevitable.

The field is new, with the first research in the area happening in the early 2000s, but the landscape is changing rapidly, with new specialised degrees opening or about to be opened.
The existing practitioners are adopting and adapting practices from Digital Preservation, Software Engineering and Software Sustainability and ensuring that how those practices are applied still reflects the conservation code of ethics.
