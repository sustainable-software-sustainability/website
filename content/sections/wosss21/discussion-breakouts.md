# Discussion breakouts
**The discussion breakouts allow groups of people to discuss a topic that interests them in a way that furthers our knowledge of that topic. This session is a fundamental part of WoSSS: it helps people learn about new ideas, explore current areas of thinking and work together on solving shared problems.**

The output of the discussions is recorded in the note taking documents provided for each group at WoSSS21.

## Schedule and topics
The Three discussion breakouts at WoSSS21 take place at the following times (each session is 45 minutes long):

 - Session 1 - Wednesday 6th October 2021 - [16:25-17:10 BST](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2021-10-06/16:25)
 - Session 2 - Thursday 7th October 2021 - [09:40-10:25 BST](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2021-10-06/09:40)
 - Session 3 -  Thursday 7th October 2021 - [16:15-17:00 BST](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2021-10-06/16:15)

Each Discussion breakout will have a list of topics which is generally relevant for the Session in which it occurs. The session list of topics will be made available to registrants of the workshop, allowing them to sign up for topics and suggest new topics.

## How does it work?
### Choosing a topic
Each of the provided topics was formulated from information provided by registrants about what they would like to discuss and what they would like to learn. Although during the sessions participants can suggest a new topic they would like to discuss.  

From the start of the session to when the breakout happens participants are free to suggest a new topic in the topic list and they should choose which topic they would like to discuss - only choose one topic as you can only be in one group.

If there are more than six in one group then form a second group discussing the same topic; in some situations you might want to have a larger group but it’s very difficult to include all participants in the discussion.

Each group will be assigned a breakout room and placed into that room.

### Once in the room
In the first few minutes, you should choose a Chair and a Reporter. The Reporter clicks the link for the collaborative note taking and blog template for their group from the Discussion Topics spreadsheet and uses that to note down the pertinent points from the discussion that can then be used as the basis for reporting back and the notes will be used as a source of information for the construction of the WoSSS21 workshop report.

The Chair’s job is to keep the discussion on track and to include the different voices in the room (if it’s a particularly large group (e.g. greater than 6) this might not be possible).

A good way to start is to ask what participants in the group want from the discussion. Are people looking to solve a problem, wanting to promote a solution, or do they simply want to know more about the topic? If you can get a handle on what people want from the discussion, it's much easier to keep everyone on topic.

Focus on what can be changed! It's easy with some topics to focus on a discussion of the problems and overlook the process of finding a solution.

The first 35 minutes can be spent exploring the topic and then last 10 minutes coming up with key points from the discussion.

These key points can include (some or all of):
 - What the problems are
 - What the current solutions are
 - What’s unsolved and needs further work
 - Who is doing good work in this area
 - Are there any other data points of interest
 - Who should lead the promotion of the work
 - Who should lead the actual work
 - What critical support is missing
 - Who should take note of what is currently happening

If you would like to take your piece further as a group after the event then please make a note of this at the top of the document - you could e.g. work towards a blog post on the [SSI Website](https://software.ac.uk/blog) or decide to produce another piece of work.

Although you are not required to write a blog post, there are further examples of outputs and tips on what can be discussed on the [SSI Speed Blogging](https://www.software.ac.uk/speed-blogging-and-tips-writing-speed-blog-post) information page.

## Reporting back  
Each session will have a formal reporting back session (each of these sessions are 15 minutes long in total) - report backs for each group should be done by the Reporter; the length of the report back will depend on the number of teams - they will be short - and could be **between 30 seconds to 1 minutes at most**!
 - Session 1 - Wednesday 6th October 2021 - [17:40-17:55 BST](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2021-10-06/17:40)
 - Session 2 - Thursday 7th October 2021 - [09:40-10:25 BST](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2021-10-06/09:40)
 - Session 3 -  Thursday 7th October 2021 - [10:25-10:40 BST](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2021-10-06/10:25)

## The final product
In the time after WoSSS21 the content from the discussion session notes will be incorporated in the draft WoSSS21 report. If members of the discussion group contribute to the re-structuring and further elaboration of the text in the draft report than we are happy to include them as co-authors on the report; all contributors to the workshop will be acknowledged (so be sure to put your full name at the top of the notes documents under the participants heading). We won’t be publishing any of the raw notes documents.
