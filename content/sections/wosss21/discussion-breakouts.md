# Discussion breakouts
**The discussion breakouts allowed groups of people to discuss a topic that interests them in a way that furthers our knowledge of that topic. This session was a fundamental part of WoSSS: it helped people learn about new ideas, explore current areas of thinking and work together on solving shared problems.**

The output of the discussions was recorded in the note taking documents provided for each group at WoSSS21.

## Schedule and topics
The Three discussion breakouts at WoSSS21 took place at the following times (each session was 45 minutes long):

 - Session 1 - Wednesday 6th October 2021 - [16:25-17:10 BST](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2021-10-06/16:25)
 - Session 2 - Thursday 7th October 2021 - [09:40-10:25 BST](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2021-10-06/09:40)
 - Session 3 -  Thursday 7th October 2021 - [16:15-17:00 BST](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2021-10-06/16:15)

Each Discussion breakout had a list of topics which was generally relevant for the Session in which it occurred. The session list of topics was made available to registrants of the workshop, allowing them to sign up for topics and suggest new topics.

## How did it work?
### Choosing a topic
Each of the provided topics was formulated from information provided by registrants about what they would like to discuss and what they would like to learn. Although during the sessions participants could suggest a new topic they would like to discuss.  

From the start of the session to when the breakout happened participants were free to suggest a new topic in the topic list and they could choose which topic they would like to discuss - only one topic could be chosen as participants could only be in one group.

If there were more than six in one group then a second group would form discussing the same topic; in some situations participants could have a larger group.

Each group was assigned a breakout room and placed into that room.

### Once in the room
In the first few minutes, participants chose a Chair and a Reporter. The Reporter clicked the link for the collaborative note taking and blog template for their group from the Discussion Topics spreadsheet and used that to note down the pertinent points from the discussion that could then be used as the basis for reporting back and the notes were used as a source of information for the construction of the WoSSS21 workshop report.

The Chairâ€™s job was to keep the discussion on track and to include the different voices in the room.

A good way to start was to ask what participants in the group what they wanted from the discussion. Were people looking to solve a problem, wanting to promote a solution, or did they simply want to know more about the topic? If the Chair could get a handle on what people wanted from the discussion, it was much easier to keep everyone on topic.

Focus was on what could be changed! It's easy with some topics to focus on a discussion of the problems and overlook the process of finding a solution.

The first 35 minutes could be spent exploring the topic and then last 10 minutes coming up with key points from the discussion.

These key points could include (some or all of):
 - What the problems were
 - What the current solutions were
 - What was unsolved and needs further work
 - Who was doing good work in this area
 - Were there any other data points of interest
 - Who should lead the promotion of the work
 - Who should lead the actual work
 - What critical support was missing
 - Who should take note of what was happening at that moment

If participants would like to take their piece further as a group after the event they were asked to make a note of this at the top of the document - they could e.g. work towards a blog post on the [SSI Website](https://software.ac.uk/blog) or decide to produce another piece of work.

Although participants were not required to write a blog post, there were further examples of outputs and tips on what could be discussed on the [SSI Speed Blogging](https://www.software.ac.uk/speed-blogging-and-tips-writing-speed-blog-post) information page.

## Reporting back  
Each session had a formal reporting back session (each of these sessions were 15 minutes long in total) - report backs for each group should be done by the Reporter; the length of the report back depended on the number of teams - they were short - and could be **between 30 seconds to 1 minutes at most**!
 - Session 1 - Wednesday 6th October 2021 - [17:40-17:55 BST](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2021-10-06/17:40)
 - Session 2 - Thursday 7th October 2021 - [09:40-10:25 BST](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2021-10-06/09:40)
 - Session 3 -  Thursday 7th October 2021 - [10:25-10:40 BST](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2021-10-06/10:25)

## The final product
In the time after WoSSS21 the content from the discussion session notes was incorporated in the draft WoSSS21 report. If members of the discussion group contributed to the re-structuring and further elaboration of the text in the draft report then we were happy to include them as co-authors on the report; all contributors to the workshop were acknowledged. We will not be publishing any of the raw notes documents.
