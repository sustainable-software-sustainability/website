# An Introduction to the UK Reproducibility Network
**by Andrew Stewart**  

## From session 3 - [Human factors and new development in preserving and sustaining research software](/wosss21-agenda#session-3)  
In this talk, I will provide a brief history and overview of the structure of the UK Reproducibility Network (UKRN). I will cover the goals of UKRN’s recently funded Research England Development Fund bid, the activities that this funding will support over the next 5 years, and some of the challenges that UK institutions face in transitioning to a more open and transparent way of conducting research.

The UK Reproducibility Network (UKRN) was launched in March 2019 by Marcus Munafò (University of Bristol), with activities coordinated by [the Steering Group](https://www.ukrn.org/steering-group/) and an [Advisory Board](https://www.ukrn.org/advisory-board/). At its inception, the UKRN brought together a number of individuals and pre-existing groups who had become increasingly focused on issues related to reproducibility, replicability, and transparency in research. Many of the early interactions took place via social media and revealed the extent to which there were overlapping concerns across disciplines and institutions around openness in research.

The creation of the UKRN provided a way to bring together those individuals and groups to work together towards solutions and advocate for cultural change. The main grassroots activities of the UKRN occur via the local networks, local network leads, and institutional representatives. Each local network (of which there are currently 63), many of which are ECR-led, engage in grassroots activities, such as forming Open Research Working Groups, that cross traditional discipline boundaries and act to promote the aims of the UKRN at their home institution. These activities can include setting up [ReproducibiliTea journal clubs](https://reproducibilitea.org/), [RIOT Science Clubs](http://riotscience.co.uk), organising regional or national workshops and conferences on transparency and reproducibility in research, organising local training events, and lobbying senior leaders to raise awareness and promote the importance of openness and transparency in research. The UKRN’s aims overlap substantially with the aims of the organisations (such as UKRI – including Research England and numerous individual research councils, Wellcome, the Software Sustainability Institute, and Jisc) that form the [External Stakeholder Group](https://www.ukrn.org/stakeholders/).

In August, Research England confirmed funding for the UKRN project “Growing and Embedding Open Research in Institutional Practice and Culture” over 5 years, beginning on September 1st 2021. This is a substantial and ambitious project with the overall aim of accelerating the uptake of high-quality open research practices across the 18 institutional members of the UKRN, and ultimately across the sector. There are three main workstreams to the project. The first involves working with academic communities to identify training gaps needed for transparent research practices, the (iterative) development of new training materials to meet the needs of these communities, a series of train-the-trainer events, and the curation of pre-existing and new training materials so that they are freely available to all (and not just to those institutional members of the UKRN). The second workstream involves developing and delivering a framework for the evaluation of institutional practice and learning in open research. Together these first two workstreams will lead to activity in workstream three which involves sharing effective practice across disciplines and institutions. Crucially, none of these workstreams assumes a “one size fits all” approach but rather will operate through collaboration with different research communities (across institutions) and through an understanding that the definition of “research openness and transparency” will mean different things in the context of different disciplines and different research methods.

One of the greatest challenges associated with re-configuring how research is carried out and reported is in terms of the incentive structures that – at an individual level – often does little to encourage the adoption of transparent research practices. Critically, the incentive structure that institutions face also does little to encourage behaviour change at an institutional level. While individuals can be incentivised to change their behaviour through the evaluation of their adoption of transparent and open research practices associated with the processes of hiring, probation, and promotion, institutions can also be incentivised to change their behaviours. These institutional incentives are likely to be financial, and so UKRI (in the form of REF) and the individual research councils have a clear role to play in rewarding institutions that embed research openness and transparency in their local research environments.
