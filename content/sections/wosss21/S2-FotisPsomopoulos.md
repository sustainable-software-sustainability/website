# Developing the ELIXIR Software Management Plan for Life Sciences
**by Fotis Psomopoulos on behalf of the ELIXIR Software Best Practices working group**  

## From session 2 - [Open Science & applying the FAIR principles to software](/wosss21-agenda#session-2)  
Data Management Plans (DMPs) are a key element of good data management and are now considered a key element of Open Science practices. A DMP describes the data management life cycle for the data to be collected, processed and/or generated within the lifetime of a particular project or activity. Conversely, a Software Management Plan (SMP) can help to formalise a set of structures and goals that ensure your software is accessible and reusable in the short, medium and long term. Although it has a management perspective, the main advantage of an SMP is that it provides clear context to the software that is being developed. In that sense, it addresses several aspects of the software development process such as (a) supporting reproducibility and reusability of the software, (b) allowing funding agencies to have a better grasp of the envisioned development process (as well as the achieved milestones), (c) increasing the awareness of the existing community standards that can/should be used, and (d) ensuring that the software can be easily accessed by the wider community.

There are several flavours of SMPs already available in one form or another. The Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) offers a very detailed [checklist](https://www.software.ac.uk/software-management-plans) that is further complemented by an online [sustainability evaluation service](https://www.software.ac.uk/resources/online-sustainability-evaluation) (SES). Several journals (such as SoftwareX and the Journal of Open Source Software) have checklists that are expected to be filled in by the software authors before any submissions addressing most of the points of an SMP. Finally, there are funding agencies (such as the Wellcome Trust) that expect a research outputs management submitted during any application.

A key downside of the aforementioned SMPs is that they tend to be rather complex, occasionally requiring deep technical knowledge of the software development process. In order to address these drawbacks, ELIXIR has put together a simplified version of an SMP, tailored for Life Science oriented projects but still general enough so as to be widely used. The primary goal of the ELIXIR SMP was to encourage wider adoption by Life Science researchers, and be as inclusive as possible to the various levels of technical expertise, while also having an explicit connection to the FAIR principles for Research Software ([FAIR4RS WG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-research-software-fair4rs-wg), [Towards FAIR principles for research software](https://content.iospress.com/articles/data-science/ds190026)). A common theme in Life Science researchers is the wide differences in background expertise, with the vast majority of researchers being self-taught research software developers. Having an SMP with a relatively low barrier in technical knowledge, while maintaining all the best practices expected in research software development, may both encourage wider adoption of these practices as well as increase the awareness of the multiple aspects involved in research software development.

The starting point for the creation of the aforementioned SMP was the [four recommendations for Open Source Software](https://f1000research.com/articles/6-876/v1). These recommendations are meant to encourage best practices in research software development. In order to incorporate the feedback of the ELIXIR community and the best practices used there, interviews were conducted during a dedicated project within the Europe BioHackathon 2019. The common practices and ideas collected from the interviews were structured around the four FAIR Research Software principles (finability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability), based on the area they were more relevant. Additional care was given towards ensuring that the main low-effort high-gain actions were captured, in order to ensure that the resulting questions had a low knowledge barrier for the expected users. The first version of the SMP, grouping the practices as described above, was presented in a dedicated webinar organized by ELIXIR in July 2020. Following that, two iterations of revision by the ELIXIR community were conducted. Specifically, developers from the ELIXIR community were invited to review and comment on the questions and corresponding options, ultimately leading to a consensus version of the SMP that incorporated all proposed changes. Currently available as a survey, future plans of the ELIXIR SMP include a human- and machine-readable version, that can be automatically queried and connected to relevant tools and metrics within the ELIXIR Tools ecosystem and, hopefully, beyond.
