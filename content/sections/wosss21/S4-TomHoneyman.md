# What we are doing towards software sustainability
**by Tom Honeyman**  

## From session 4 - [Sustaining the community and promoting (human) infrastructures for software sustainability](/wosss21/agenda#session-4)  
The Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) is a national facility supported by the federally funded national collaborative research infrastructure strategy (NCRIS) scheme. In this role the ARDC is a provider or coinvestor in several areas of digital infrastructure including national programs in storage, compute, data, informatics services, skilled workforce, policy, platforms and now software.

The software program is a new initiative from the ARDC signalling an interest to move into research software. The program is operating under a strategic aim to achieve recognition of research software as a first-class output of research. As part of this work, a draft "National Agenda for Research Software" was released in June this year to stimulate discussion amongst partners in action towards this strategic aim, and to consider what contributions they might make. Based on responses to the draft agenda, the ARDC is now starting to initiate activities tied to the framework laid out in the agenda.

The agenda builds on three high level actions to "See, Shape and Sustain Research Software" which consider the visibility and availability of research software, the application of software engineering best practice to shape research software for easiest and broadest meaningful reuse, and the maintenance and longevity of relevant research software infrastructure (including particularly the workforce of maintainers and developers as a form of soft infrastructure).

In order to turn these three high level actions into a tractable set of tasks, they are each further broken down into consideration of the necessary infrastructure, guidance, communities and advocacy work needed to make them possible, easy, normal and codified. This gives an overall set of 12 interrelated actions that form the agenda. Further to this, national stakeholders are characterised and then mapped to these actions.

The ARDC is considering activities across all 12 actions in the agenda, but the early focus will be on areas of infrastructure and communities.

We will be considering what is possible under the status quo (i.e., areas of infrastructure) by commissioning three reports to characterise the national informatics landscape that supports software assets, the existence and distribution of Australian supported research software, and the existence and distribution of the workforce supporting the development and maintenance of research software infrastructure. These three reports will form a baseline measure of our national capacity in research software.

To drive development and normalisation of best practice, we are looking to build or support national communities of practice focussing on researchers, support staff, and career research software engineers. We will also look to seed the development of local, regional and national communities that bridge the worlds of research and software engineering.

To ease change, our initial areas of guidance development will focus on easing the adoption of best practice software publishing and software citation, as well as socialising and facilitating adoption of the nascent FAIR4RS principles.

Our initial work in advocacy will focus on code availability, but we are anticipating expanding to include credit for new software, and structure to support maintaining research software.
