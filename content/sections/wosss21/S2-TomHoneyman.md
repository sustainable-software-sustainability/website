# FAIR adoption
**by Tom Honeyman**  

## From session 2 - [Open Science & applying the FAIR principles to software](/wosss21/agenda#session-2)  
The Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) is a national facility supported by the federally funded national collaborative research infrastructure strategy (NCRIS) scheme. In this role the ARDC is a provider or coinvestor in several areas of digital infrastructure including national programs in storage, compute, data, informatics services, skilled workforce, policy, platforms and software.

In seeking to adopt the FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) principles, the ARDC is considering action across several of these programs.

Within platforms that include JupyterHub we'll be looking for opportunities to incorporate features or guidance relating to the principles. The ARDC is developing an easily deployable jupyterHub-based platform as a service to be deployed within our national ARDC Nectar research cloud. We see this as an opportunity to put the guidance and encouragement to adopt the principles and other best practices relating to research software authorship close to the authors themselves. Similarly, we will look to encourage the same with our platforms coinvestment projects that also incorporate jupyterHub.

Within our own in-house software development we'll be looking to make that software FAIR. We will leverage this as an example of best practice to show partner organisations. Within our coinvestment programs we'll be looking to work with project partners who are developing research software tools to assist them in applying the principles.

Within our skilled workforce work, we'll be looking at incorporating FAIR4RS into our training materials, and other guidance materials (used broadly throughout Australia). Based on the ARDC "FAIR data self assessment tool", we will be developing a similar tool to aid socialisation of what adopting the principles might look like at different levels. This tool will not be targeting software authors themselves, but rather support staff, managers, policy makers and other roles that impact upon the authors of research software.

Consistent with our existing policy advocacy work with relevant national bodies and research organisations, we will continue to advocate for FAIR outputs (particularly within our national signatory obligations under the OECD recommendations concerning data from publicly funded sources), but direct interested parties to the FAIR4RS principles when considering what actions might apply to research software. That is, we will advocate for FAIR data and software.

Our own policy regarding outputs from co-investments will be updated to clarify expectations. Specifically, where reasonable, they should be applying the FAIR4RS principles to software outputs arising from co-investment, instead of interpreting and applying the original FAIR principles to all outputs.

Finally, under the software program we will look to socialise and further assist in adoption of the FAIR4RS principles amongst the national software authoring communities that we support or facilitate.
