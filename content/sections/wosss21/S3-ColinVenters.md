# The Lost Architectures of Scientific Software and How to Find Them
**by Colin Venters**  

## From session 3 - [Human factors and new development in preserving and sustaining research software](/wosss21/agenda#session-3)  
Modern scientific and engineering research is highly dependent on software. Its importance in driving forward advances in research in the field of computational science and engineering has resulted in calls for it to be classified as a first-class experimental scientific instrument. However, software as a research instrument has not reached a level of maturity compared with the conventional tools of empirical and theoretical science (Goble, 2014). Why? Research software is principally developed by end-user developers who have a limited understanding and application of fundamental software engineering concepts, principles, and techniques, combined with a "code-first" approach to development, which is in part driven by the complexity and uncertainty of the problem. This results in research software with suboptimal software design, if any, leading to accidental complexity, technical debt, code smells, and an increase in the risk of software entropy. Similarly, while Research Software Engineering aims to facilitate the creation of well-designed, reliable, efficient software to solve research problems there is little empirical evidence to demonstrate that the research software created is well designed, if at all, understandable, maintainable and extensible. The consequences of accidental software complexity lead to a range of rotten symptoms, including software rigidity, fragility, immobility, and viscosity that are a pathway to stagnation, decay, and the long-term decline of essential research software investment (Booch, 2006).

Sustainability is generally understood as the capacity of a socio-technical system to endure (Becker et al. 2015). While a number of communities have attempted to address the challenges of achieving sustainability from their different perspectives, there is a severe lack of common understanding of the fundamental concepts of sustainability and how it relates to software systems. As a result, there is no agreed definition of software sustainability or how it might be achieved. While there have been a number of contributions to formalise a definition of software sustainability, the concept remains an elusive and ambiguous term with individuals, groups and organisations holding diametrically opposed views (Venters et al. 2014). This lack of clarity ultimately leads to confusion, and potentially to ineffective and inefficient efforts to develop sustainable software systems.

The future of scientific and engineering enterprise requires a resilient eco-system of software (Wiese, Polato and Pinto, 2020). Software design is a key component of sustainable software, which starts with software architecture (Durdik, 2012). Software architectures represent the set of structures required to reason about the system, which comprises both software elements, their properties and relationships (Bass, Clements, and Kazman, 2012). Software architecture is fundamental to the development of technically sustainable software as they lay the foundation for the successful implementation, maintenance and evolution of sustainable software systems in a continually changing execution environment by providing a mechanism for reasoning about core software quality requirements that contribute to sustainability as a first-class, composite software quality (van Vliet, 2008). By addressing software sustainability at the architectural level, it allows the inhibiting or enabling of systems quality attributes, reasoning about and managing change as the system evolves, predicting system qualities, as well as measuring architecturally significant requirements. However, the ability to determine sustainability as a core software quality of a software system from an architectural perspective remains an open research challenge, and existing architectural principles need to be adapted and novel architectural paradigms devised. In addition, there is a pressing need for new tooling to fit today's emergent and dynamic environments, where essential research software is explicitly designed for continuous evolvability and adaptability without incurring prohibitive architectural, technical debt (Northrop, 2018).

This micro-talk argues that sustainable software is that which is explicitly designed for continuous maintainability and evolvability without incurring prohibitive technical debt and a negative impact on the dimensions of sustainability and presents the results of a case study on the technical sustainability of the MERLIN++ particle accelerator tracking library originally developed in 2000 at Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron.
