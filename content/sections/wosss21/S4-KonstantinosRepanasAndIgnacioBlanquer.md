# Research Software Sustainability in the EOSC
**by Konstantinos Repanas and Ignacio Blanquer**  

## From session 4 - [Sustaining the community and promoting (human) infrastructures for software sustainability](/wosss21/agenda#session-4)  
The European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) aims at providing European researchers a virtual environment for open access to services to store, share, process and reuse research data and other research digital objects, such as software. Scientific software is both a key asset for the reproducibility of science and a research output that is re-usable to create new knowledge. We present the EOSC initiative and how research software preservation, reuse and quality enhancement is increasing in importance and focus, covering the future plans of the EOSC Association Task Forces and how they will address the sustainability of Research Software.
