# Changing our ways: Making Inclusion a Core Feature
**by Emma Irwin**  

## From session 3 - [Human factors and new development in preserving and sustaining research software](/wosss21/agenda#session-3)  
As we look to technology to solve some of the world's biggest challenges it's critically important that we understand how the history of  racism, sexism, ableism, casteism and other biases has shaped the technology we use today; that while the small steps being made to increase diversity, to address hate and harm online are encouraging, the true potential lies in our ability to move from 'having good intentions' to systemically evaluating, evolving and changing how we build software.

Open source software, which is less diverse than tech overall (despite the notion of  openness) sadly,  has as many stories of toxicity, exclusion and harm as it does innovative success stories. There is plenty of research, and storytelling that tells us why . We even have a set of metrics being developed both by a cross-community effort called CHAOSS and work by the U.N's to define a framework for digital inclusion. What's still lacking is a way to apply this knowledge and associated actions into our every day engineering and community practices.

 In this talk, I'll share some of the my research, the CHAOSS project metrics and early work to embed metrics for inclusion into the every day with the hope to inspire new ideas to ensure that the solutions we're building for the world, reflect the challenges and potential of everyone in it.
