# The Role of Fiscal Sponsorship in Open Software
**by Andy R. Terrel**  

## From session 2 - [Open Science & applying the FAIR principles to software](/wosss21/agenda#session-2)  
Open source software is very often a work of passion to scratch the authors itch. What happens when that passion goes stale? Just as a pair of young lovers, the software community must evolve its relationship, i.e. someone has to do the dishes.

While early open source projects could organize around a few people with not many resources, today's projects often include hundreds of contributors working for numerous companies. Additionally, the people of the project are spread across dozens of countries complicating many legal issues. To meet this need of maturing software projects numerous fiscal sponsor organizations have been formed. Fiscal Sponsorship manage the project financial, legal, and organizational resources.  It also allows projects with similar organizing principles to come together and produce common goods.

In this presentation, we use NumFOCUS as a case study to show the various aspects of the Fiscal Sponsor. NumFOCUS founded in 2012 has grown to sponsor over fifty scientific software projects with a vibrant educational program to help a growing community learn and build new tools.
