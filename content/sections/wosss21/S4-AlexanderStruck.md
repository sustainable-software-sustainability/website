# (Inter)National Community Efforts by the German Association of Research Software Engineers (de-RSE)
**by Alexander Struck**  

## From session 4 - [Sustaining the community and promoting (human) infrastructures for software sustainability](/wosss21/agenda#session-4)  
The talk provides an overview of past, current and future efforts within the de-RSE community to create sustainable (human) infrastructure and working environments. Half a decade ago, first conferences, workshops, calls and national working groups appeared where focus had shifted from research data to software. The UK RSE conference in 2016 certainly affected or ignited community efforts abroad. Similar efforts by German organisations for the Digital Humanities (FORGE 2016) and Natural Sciences (HGFOS16) supported national efforts to gather a community around research software. The alliance of all German research organizations initiated a working group and later published well-received guidelines for software aspects. The same year 2016 saw its first call for funding applications to improve software and infrastructure.

During the following years, conferences and workshops had tracks on software, and a community started to emerge. Discussions about lobbying for RS-Engineering and Engineers also led to the foundation of the de-RSE society, and a year later in 2019, the first (inter)national conference took place with about 200 participants.

The past years also saw workshops on software policy, publishing, licensing. Software Carpentries received attention. The de-RSE community flourished, as measured in society members, mailing-list size, and twitter followers. More and more local chapters appear and effort is spent on international collaboration.  

Members of the national community are currently involved in efforts to instantiate a European Software Sustainability Institute. Several members took part in a larger DFG-sponsored workshop and published a position paper on our environment. Others and the speaker are involved in the FAIR4RS WG. There we try to find a usable definition for research software, how the FAIR principles need to be amended to be applicable to our software and how we could improve adoption.

Unfortunately, recognition of software as a research result is still lacking as well as recognition of RSEs as valuable human infrastructure for excellent research. More work is needed here to initiate changes towards sustainable environments for RS-Engineers and for the software being written or re-used.
