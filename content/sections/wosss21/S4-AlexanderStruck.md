I will go over how it all started over here, what we have done so far how, how it's going and we want to go.

2016 was the interesting and significant year, we saw the UK RSE Conference, after which some of the participants decided to launch a German RC chapter. We had several national workshops on research software next to research data.

In 2016, we also had the first call for proposals by the National research funding organisation to show off best practice examples for sustainable infrastructure, and for the first time improve existing software, and not only write new software. This was much needed, and this call was over signed by a think a factor of 15. And then we saw a second call later in 2019.

In the same year, 2016, the Alliance of the German Research Organisations with names you can see over here, decided to fund the working group on research software, and later published guidelines for research software and digital services.

And then two years later, we were able to form our own society. The guy on the right in the brown shirt decided to have even another chapter for the digital humanities because they thought that would be necessary, and we had developed at our University, the CIO, was convinced to have the RSE of the university to come together and we started talking.

One year later, the first German conference with international participation from six countries to place, 200 people and it was a blast.

More highlights were, for example, a workshop on software policies with some publications later on, more local chapters popping off, and a growing community. And we constantly strive for increased international collaboration because we think that is the way to go. We’re currently, as you all know, involved in the European sustainability infrastructure. We recently wrote and published a paper on the German landscape on research software sustainability, which I will talk on later. Some of us, including myself, are involved in the FAIR4 Research Software working group where we work on the definition of research software, how to apply the FAIR principles and how to get it all adopted.

This is all promising and looks good, but we still face a lot of challenges. For example, the lack of incentives. So especially in Germany, a researcher in a short fixed-term contract has hardly any incentive to write sustainable software. There's hardly any motivation to maintain that software, even after it has published, maybe by requirement from a journal. And the motivation to gain the knowledge or development skills to write sustainable software are also very low because these people often have to focus on their next job. We all know that the motivation to cite software is currently quite low, but we are happy to see the actions Github took.

Another challenge is of course, the recognition of software as the first-class citizen of scientific results. I was involved in evaluation of current Research Information Systems for our organisation and none of the commercial providers had any mention of software or data in most cases. So we decided to go for our own information system, how it works for us, and we included data publication, software and some other uses we write, from our designers. The collaboration among, even within organisation and among organisations maybe even crossing borders is difficult. And we often see silos, a local Gitlab server is fine but hard to collaborate on an international project. What we still see is the ‘not invented here syndrome’ due to a mistrust of third-party software, sometimes justified. We don't have software management plans very often, and unfortunately the public funding organisations still think that they only need to fund new software, and do not really care about we re-use at the moment; that's the impression.

We see some brain drain because the challenges our Research Software Engineers face are not really carreer-friendly. We recently had a discussion in Germany where Junior researchers, including RSEs, are seen as disposable resources, as the market is believed to offer new staff all the time. Unfortunately, the scientific contract law in Germany requires organisations to let scientific staff go after six or 12 years unless they became professor. We still lake human infrastructure, like the Software Sustainability Institute, and we still have to lobby very hard for Research Software Engineering in the NFDI consortia application.

More on that on this slide, there were two funding calls and the German RSEs that together tried to get an application running but were told that it's not really up to them to apply because it was too cross-domain a fund call. And so, at the moment we only have research data infrastructure consortia on domain specific knowledge areas. And we still lobby for, let's say, software being injected or implemented as a topic of these working groups, they have a 3rd round and discussion, so let's see how this is going. 

We did envision some solutions, especially in the paper that I mentioned earlier, which I will dive a bit deeper in saying that recognition could be tackled by implementing some selection criteria for software that should be sustained, so should receive funding, and you think usage and impact might be the first criteria to be considered for some selection process. The paper provides much more, and I was I just want to know that some of these criteria resemble questions you may see in a software management plan, which unfortunately, is still optional in most funding calls.

We think awareness could be tackled by training, and providing more training, that means that maybe some curricula in the universities need to be adjusted so that everyone has research software in their application. We think SMP should be mandatory, carpentries should be utilised much more. and everyone should become more aware of the pitfalls that all the legalities pose. And awareness includes the first international RSE day next week.

We Think we require adequate funding for maintenance infrastructure and training. Seed funding is still necessary, of course, but in Germany, we now have more than 20 frameworks for image annotation and maybe not every one of them is worth it. The software that is sustained should meet the criteria and maybe then we will see some long-term positions, which we very much need. You think the data and computing centres should receive dedicated funding for their hardware and their services, where the recearch software is developed or is tested. And of course, for training, how to use that. RSE education material and software documentation should receive funding as well.

And I think in the end, it all boils down to better infrastructure. As I mentioned before, international collaborative development tools and authentication authorisation infrastructure is needed. We already heard about the international sustainability infrastructure. I think the carpentries can be seen as infrastructure because they provide the training, and we also promote more international and domain specific platforms to discover, publish and archive your digital artefacts, especially software. And again, we very much need a little help desk to inform the research project RSEs about, let's say, funding conditions, licenses, liabilities and so on. And with that, I want to close and thank you for your attention.
