# WoSSS21 - Attendee Procedure For Reporting Harassment

1.  Please contact any member of the Code of Conduct (CoC) Committee:

    *   Shoaib Sufi, WoSSS21 Lead and Co-Chair, Software Sustainability Institute Community Lead, [shoaib.sufi@software.ac.uk](mailto:shoaib.sufi@software.ac.uk)
    *   Carlos Martinez-Ortiz, WoSSS21 Co-Chair, Community Manager - Natural Sciences & Engineering Netherlands eScience Center, [c.martinez@esciencecenter.nl](mailto:c.martinez@esciencecenter.nl)
    *   Rachael Ainsworth, Research Software Community Manager, Software Sustainability Institute, [rachael.ainsworth@manchester.ac.uk](mailto:peter.doorn@dans.knaw.nl)
    *   Lieke de Boer, Community Manager - Social Sciences & Humanities, Netherlands eScience Centre, [l.deboer@esciencecenter.nl](mailto:l.deboer@esciencecenter.nl) 

The CoC Committee is prepared to handle the incident. All of our Committee members are informed of the [Code of Conduct policy](/wosss21/participation-guidelines#code-of-conduct) and [guide for handling harassment](/wosss21/staff-procedure-handling-reported-harassment) at the workshop. There will be a mandatory CoC Committee meeting just prior to the workshop when this will be reiterated as well.

2.  Report the harassment incident via private message in Slack or as an email to a member of the CoC Committee. All reports are confidential.

3.  When reporting the event to a CoC Committee member, try to gather as much information as available, but do not interview people about the incident. The Committee member will assist you in writing the report/collecting information.

4.  The important information we need consists of:

    *   Identifying information (name) of the participant doing the harassing
    *   The behaviour that was in violation
    *   The approximate time of the behaviour (if different than the time the report was made)
    *   The circumstances surrounding the incident
    *   Other people involved in the incident

5.  The CoC Committee will handle the incident following the [Staff Procedure For Handling Reported Harassment](/wosss21/staff-procedure-handling-reported-harassment).

6.  Even though this is an online workshop if at any time you feel that your personal safety is in jeopardy then contact your local Police / law enforcement service.
