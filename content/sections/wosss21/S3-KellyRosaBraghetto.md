# The FLOSS Competence Center as an Enabler of High-Quality Open Research Software in Brazil
**by Kelly Rosa Braghetto**  

## From session 3 - [Human factors and new development in preserving and sustaining research software](/wosss21/agenda#session-3)  
The Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) Competence Center of the University of São Paulo (USP), Brazil, encompasses activities related to undergraduate and graduate education, research, development, and publicizing of free and open-source software. The center’s primary goal is to foster the development, research, and adoption of FLOSS both inside and outside the university, by providing for users and developers high-quality resources and expertise on the various topics related to open-source software.

Since its creation in 2008, the center has been performing a fundamental role in supporting the Brazilian scientific community to embrace openness. The center offers training, consulting, and hosting to researchers from any field of science, to support the production of high-quality open research software. It provides assistance to researchers not only on tools, platforms, and licenses but also on methodologies, studies, and best practices in software development.

Despite its importance and high impact, the FLOSS Competence Center’s scope of action is too small, considering Brazil’s large extension and inequalities. There is a lack of country-wide open science practical initiatives and incentives of funding agencies and research institutions, which should provide physical infrastructure, information, and human resources to assist researchers.

Brazil started formal initiatives to adopt open government data in 2011 by creating the Law on Access to Information and co-founding the Open Government Partnership (OGP), which now has 77 other signatory countries. The biennial Open Government National Action Plans have raised awareness and commitments to open science.  But it is worth mentioning that Brazil became a leader of the open access movement much before that. The Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), recognized as one of the most important open-access programs in the world, was established in 1997. Concerning the management of open research data, coordinated actions started to take shape only more recently, with the creation in 2018 of a working group to draft the National Policy for Open Science and the adherence of Brazil to the GO FAIR initiative. A few distributed efforts stand out while the national policy is not implemented, mainly on the biggest public research institutions and wealthiest state funding agencies.

The State of São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) is one of Brazil’s main funding agencies for scientific and technological research. FAPESP has been defining policies and fostering initiatives towards open science aligned with what other countries practice.

Since 2017, FAPESP requires from researchers Data Management Plans upon submission of project proposals.  The data produced in projects funded by FAPESP must be stored in institutional repositories, preserving them and making them openly accessible (subject to the applicable standards and constraints).

Also in 2017, FAPESP started a workforce to develop a state network of open research data repositories, formed by the São Paulo state’s six public universities (including USP), the Aeronautics Institute of Technology (ITA), and the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA). The repository that gathers research data metadata from the network institutions was launched in 2019. The network’s infrastructure is also being used to share pseudonymized data of Covid-19 patients (~800K), contributing to essential researches on several countries.

In 2019, FAPESP formalized its open access policy for publications, under which all journal papers that result from FAPESP-funded research must be made publicly available in institutional open access repositories (as long as this does not violate copyright rules).

Some funding lines at FAPESP already require that all software developed within a funded project be licensed as free software. However, differently from the case of research data, there are no institutional supporting resources (such as guidelines and metadata repositories) to help researchers appropriately develop, preserve, and disseminate their research software. Until now, the sustainability of research software seems to be out of the official working groups’ radar.

This scenario highlights the importance of reinforcing and replicating the work that the FLOSS Competence Center is doing. Moreover, it exposes the urgent need for the Brazilian government, research institutions, and funding agencies to finance and cooperate to build appropriate infrastructure and establish models, skills, and policies to sustain the Brazilian research software.
