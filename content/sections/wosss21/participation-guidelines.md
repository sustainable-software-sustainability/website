# WoSSS21 - Participation Guidelines

The Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) was the [lead partner](/partners) in the delivery of the 2021 edition of the Workshop on Sustainable Software Sustainability 2021 ([WoSSS21](/wosss21/home/)). The workshop brought together participants from a broad range of communities that were interested in how to deal with software sustainability, primarily from the perspective of scholarly and scientific research. 

We valued the participation of each stakeholder and wanted all participants to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all participants were expected to show respect and courtesy to other participants throughout the workshop and through all communication channels, including but not limited to the collaborative documents, Slack workspace and Zoom (and/or any additional platform used to facilitate the event). 

To make clear what was expected, all participants (including speakers, exhibitors, organisers and volunteers) at WoSSS21 were required to agree to and abide by the following set of Participation Guidelines. 

Please note that minor changes and additions were made to these participation guidelines up until the event in the spirit of the existing guidelines (such as linking to an additional tool’s privacy policy or clarifying the response to different Code of Conduct scenarios). Changes will be documented in the Change Log at the bottom of the page.

If you have any questions about these Participation Guidelines, please contact WoSSS21 Lead - Shoaib Sufi at [shoaib.sufi@software.ac.uk](mailto:shoaib.sufi@software.ac.uk).

## Code of Conduct

### Summary

WoSSS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free workshop experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of workshop participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. 

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Treat everyone with respect.

Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and exclusionary jokes are not appropriate at WoSSS events. Do not send any unprofessional messages to other participants including, but not limited to, private messages in Slack and Zoom.

Participants violating these rules may be asked to leave the workshop at the sole discretion of the workshop organisers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

### Clarifications

Harassment includes offensive communication related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour were expected to comply immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that words can be offensive to those around you. 

Examples of behaviour that is not welcome or appropriate at WoSSS workshops include offensive jokes, use of sexual language and imagery, excessive swearing, and repeatedly talking over or interrupting other participants.

WoSSS takes Diversity and Inclusion seriously. We want to promote an open but respectful environment to help shift the research software community to be more inclusive and welcoming to people from different backgrounds. To this end, please be mindful of the language and tone that you use when discussing points of view and lived experiences.

If a participant engaged in behaviour that violated this Code of Conduct, the workshop organisers could take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, removing speaking privileges, or expulsion from the workshop.
