Hi, I'm Carly Strasser, and I'm coming to you from San Francisco, California. I'd like to thank the organisers of this meeting for inviting me to speak about supporting the creators and maintainers of essential open source software for science. I am the Programme Manager for open science at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. And we're based out of San Francisco, California.

If you're not familiar with the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, we're a relatively new foundation. We are about five years old, and we have several different areas of focus. But the work that I do is housed in the CZI science programme. And our goal is to support science and technology that will make it possible to cure, prevent or manage all disease by the end of the century. Within the CZI science programme, I'm part of the Open Science Group. And our focus is the universal and immediate open sharing of all scientific knowledge and outputs by the end of the century.

To accomplish that mission, we have five main areas that we focus on. The first is support for tools and resources for research. The second is funding education and capacity building groups to enable open science best practices. We also focus on metrics and incentives for open science. And we support platforms for sharing data methods and other outputs, most recognisably preprints. And finally, we fund improving infrastructure and integration to enable better open science.

I'm going to focus on this first item, which is support for tools and research resources for research. In 2019, there was a paper that came out shortly after the event horizon announcement, which was a big science announcement that happened a few years back. And this article was telling the story of the folks that were working on the event horizon project, and their efforts to get funding to support open source software that they used in the course of that work. And the quote was just five days after the announcement, the NSF rejected a grant proposal to support the scientific Python ecosystem, saying that it lacked sufficient impact. And this is particularly interesting, because a lot of the scientific Python that is used is highly, highly impactful if you're thinking about things in terms of dependencies.

So software that depends on a package like matplotlib, there are around 345,000+ different projects that rely on that software. And I would say that that's a pretty good measure of its impact. However, that's not how groups like the National Science Foundation and many funders perceive how we can be measuring impact.
There was a more recent article that came out about the lack of investment in digital research infrastructure. And there was a great quote in this Nature article, which was recommending that we fund, maintain, and have viable career paths, even if researchers involved are writing more lines of computer code than lines in an academic manuscript. That it was really important to support the ecosystem of research software to ensure that we continue to have ongoing good software that we can build our science on.

So, enter the Essential Open Source Software for Science project. This is our flagship project that we fund within the Open Science programme at CCI. And the thinking behind this programme; it was born a couple of years ago, and it was really in recognition of the fact that the majority of open source software for science is undervalued and it lacks funding for maintenance, growth, development, and community engagement, especially after the initial phase when it's linked to the original research.

So, enter the EOSS programme. The objective is to support software maintenance, growth, development and community engagement for critical open source tools. And this is really a nod to recognising that we need to ensure that the maintainers and contributors to these projects both have their contributions be visible and recognised within the science communities. We also need to support the unmet needs in maintenance, community building and DEI, and make these things more fundable by other funders as well.

This is a snapshot of the different projects that we fund through the Essential Open Source Software for Science programme. I'm sure you're recognising a few names here. And these span discipline specific, all the way to general foundational tools in research software. And these were all funded over the course of four rounds of requests for applications. And those four rounds of funding for these projects has ended in around $23 million in investment in open source software.

What you're seeing now is a breakdown of the proposals that we funded in the various domains; so neuroscience, imaging, genomics, etc. As well as an italics, there's three buckets of proposals that we funded that we think of as more foundational; so they focus on visualization, machine learning and data analysis and data management and workflows. So, you can see that we have a pretty wide swath of investments across these different areas, across the four requests for applications, USS one through four. And we are particularly interested in imaging this most recent round, because we did have some supplemental imaging funding from our imaging community within CCI to amplify the projects that came into the request for applications that reflected imaging tools.

In addition to the main EOSS projects that we fund, we most recently announced our EOSS diversity and inclusion supplemental grant programme. This is a nod to the fact that many of these software suites and projects are run and maintained primarily by Western males. And so, the goal here was to build participation, retention and Leadership Progression for contributors for members from underrepresented groups in scientific open source software. And the way that we went about doing this, this was to fund diversity and inclusion interventions in select EOSS projects. So, from that slide with all those different names of projects, we invited all current and former EOSS grantees to apply for funding to support a variety of interventions. And these included things like internships, mentoring programmes, workshops. We asked them to specify what areas of underrepresentation they were targeting, and we got a broad range of dimensions, including gender, ethnicity, race, geographic location, and accessibility. And then finally, we encourage those EOSS groups to partner between open source maintainer and then partner with those leading organisations in the DEI space. So groups that are already working in this space and have ideas on how we can improve representation. So in this programme, we received 25 letters of intent, and that resulted in 14 proposals being funded for a total of $5 million.

These are three examples of the types of projects we funded for the supplemental grant programme. QUIIME 2 is a software platform for microbiome analysis. And they're using it as an onramp to help Native American students learn more about scientific computing. And they partnered with groups at the institution theyâ€™re housed, which is the Northern Arizona University. 

Common Workflow Language is a standard for biomedical analysis workflows, and they used the funds to hire a community engineer who also partners with mentoring internships, and provides updates to Code and Documentation. And the partner that they're working with is Outreachy, which is an internship programme that provides paid internships to underrepresented groups. And then finally, UCSC Xena, which is a visual exploration resource, and they are partnering with the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute Research Mentoring Internship Programme to establish an internship programme for underrepresented groups to work with UCSC's Xena tool.

So, with that, I'll wrap up and leave it to the rest of the panelists. Thank you for giving me your time and attention. If you're interested in the EOSS project we will have future calls for proposals, probably not in the next 12 months, but keep an eye out at Chan zuckerberg.com/eoss. We also have general information about the Open Science programme and some of the other things that we fund at the URL there. And you can always reach out to us through the general email openscience@chanzuckerberg.com. Thank you so much.
