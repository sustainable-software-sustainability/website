# The People Roadmap: Mapping people-related initiatives in the research software community
**by Michelle Barker**  

## From session 4 - [Sustaining the community and promoting (human) infrastructures for software sustainability](/wosss21/agenda#session-4)  
The People Roadmap is a Research Software Alliance (ReSA) consultation to map the landscape of research software community initiatives focused on people-themed issues, as part of ReSAâ€™s mission is to bring research software communities together to collaborate on the advancement of the research software ecosystem.

28 organisations, community initiatives and/or projects in the research software community have been profiled as part of the creation of the People Roadmap, to facilitate identification and opportunities for accelerating efforts to address major issues related to personnel challenges. The People Roadmap aims to increase understanding on how to create an environment where research software personnel are recognised, have appropriate skill sets and access to inclusive communities, within policy and infrastructure environments that support their work.  

The People Roadmap was conceived in response to the evolution of a range of research and software areas, including 1) the rise of open science (which includes open software), 2) increased understanding of the need for advanced digital skills in the research community (including research software engineering) to achieve the aims of open science, and 3) the development of the Research Software Engineering movement to recognise and support the Research Software Engineers who are responsible for the development and maintenance of a significant amount of research software.
