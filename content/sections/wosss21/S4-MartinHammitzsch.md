# The fundamental part of software: the human infrastructure

## From session 4 - [Sustaining the community and promoting (human) infrastructures for software sustainability](/wosss21/agenda#session-4)  
Infrastructures are facilities, services, and installations needed for the functioning of communities. Whereas facilities and installations can be an array of equipment set up for use, facilities are also abilities and aptitudes to perform activities and to serve particular functions. In this regard, services are assistance and help, they are abilities set up as work and duties done for others. Following these definitions we take a look at different aspects of the fundamental part of research software – the human infrastructure – and what it takes to ensure its sustainability and thus software sustainability.

The human infrastructure of research software involves communities, on the one hand, those having a demand for software, and on the other hand, those meeting these needs. Ensuring measures that support both of them necessitates: firstly, common policies, guidelines and procedures that community members can follow; secondly, awareness, training and exchange that enable community members; thirdly, work capacities that community members can make use of; and, finally, funding that allows members of the communities to take advantage of support measures as well as to provide these support measures.

The measures comprise community building and the sustaining of these communities. They are manifold and, among others, e.g., involve the elaboration and adoption of best practices with policies, the passing on of knowledge and skills with training, the initiation and promotion of collaborations and exchange with hacky hours and fellowship programs, the giving of advice with consulting, and the implementation of software with research software engineering.

In some places these measures are implemented in a structured manner and with success, in other places they depend on the voluntary commitment of individuals and groups. Sharing resources across wider geographical areas with a coordinated and structured approach would, however, be advantageous in Europe across the board. The cooperation between those involved regionally and locally has already established itself nationally and internationally at the working level. But the collaboration between European countries in a structured approach seems like the next logical step to address the shared needs with a coordinated and efficient use of resources.

We will take a look at some of these aspects from a human infrastructure and community perspective that is expecting trusted, reliable and supported infrastructures containing multi-purpose and tailor-made software for their research work. Finally, we aim to address unsolved issues in understanding research software as (human) infrastructure and in managing, implementing, operating, maintaining and developing it as such.
